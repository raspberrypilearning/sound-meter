## You will make

Do you sometimes get tired of our noisy lives and just want a bit of quiet time? 

In this project, you are going to make a sound level meter that will display how noisy it is on your micro:bit. You will also learn how to save that data to your micro:bit so you can see the noisiest times of the day. You will also create a way of letting other people know that the noise level is too high, so they know to keep it quiet, even if just for a few minutes.

Something about TERM <span style="color: #0faeb0">TERM</span> Something about TERM
</p>

You will:
+ Use your micro:bit to play music
+ Use variables and logic to allow for a choice of melody
+ Use input buttons and gestures to control the playback
+ Share your project with others so they can try it out and you can get feedback

## What next?

If you are following the [Introduction to micro:bit](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/path-name) path, you can move on to the [Sleep tracker](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/sleep-tracker) project. 

In this project, you will make a sleep tracker that uses the micro:bit's accelerometer to track how many times you move in the night. Getting good sleep is really important to help you feel your best!

## Upgrade your project

Fantastic effort! You have created your micro:bit sound level meter. Here are some ideas to upgrade your project and create a more advanced sound level meter:

+ Use a different sensor - light for V2 or temperature for V1
+ Show an icon for maximum/minimum sound levels
+ Add more levels of sensitivity

### Play ▶️

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  

Click on the embedded project.

Drag the yellow light level in the circle up and down, see what happens with the LEDs. 
Press the A or B buttons to change the sensitivity:
+ How many levels are there?
+ What happens on the minimum and maximum?
Once the alarm sounds, click the logo at the top to reset it.

## Log the sound level

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
You will create your MakeCode project and add code to measure the sound (or light) levels. You will display the current level on the LEDs for the user.

### Open MakeCode

To start creating your micro:bit project, you need to open the MakeCode editor.

--- task ---

Open the MakeCode editor at [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org){:target="_blank"}

--- collapse ---

---
title: Offline version of the editor
---

There is also a [downloadable version of the MakeCode editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/offline-app){:target="_blank"}.

--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---

### First micro:bit project?

[[[makecode-tour]]]

### Create your project

Once the editor is open, you will need to create a new project and give your project a name. 

--- task ---

Click on the **New Project** button.

<img src="images/new-project-button.png" alt="The new project button in MakeCode." width="250"/>

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Give your new project the name `sound level meter` and click **Create**.

<img src="images/soundlevel-meter.png" alt="The name 'sound level meter' written in the New Project dialogue box." width="350"/>

**Tip:** To make it easier to find your project later, give it a helpful name that relates to the activity youâ€™re creating.

--- /task ---

### Plot a graph of the sound level

In this project, you will make use of the `on start`{:class="microbitbasic"} block, but not the `forever`{:class="microbitbasic"} block. 

--- task ---

You can delete the `forever`{:class="microbitbasic"} block now by dragging it to the menu panel.

![Animation showing the forever block being deleted by dragging it back on top of the block menus.](images/delete-forever.gif)

--- /task ---

The first step is to get the micro:bit to capture the sound levels at regular intervals. There is a specifc loop you can use to do this.

--- task ---

From the `Loops`{:class="microbitloops"} menu, drag an `every 500 ms`{:class="microbitloops"} block and place it in the code editor panel.

<img src="images/every-500ms.png" alt="The Loops menu with the 'every 500 ms' block highlighted." width="350"/>

Any code inside this loop will run every **500 milliseconds**. 

1000 milliseconds is 1 second, so this loop will run every **half second**.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

From the `Led`{:class="microbitled"} menu, drag a `plot bar graph`{:class="microbitled"} block.

<img src="images/plot-bargraph.png" alt="The Led menu with the 'plot bar graph' block highlighted." width="350"/>

Place it inside the `every 500 ms`{:class="microbitloops"} block.

```microbit
loops.everyInterval(500, function () {
    led.plotBarGraph(
    0,
    0
    )
})
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

From the `Input`{:class="microbitinput"} menu, drag a `sound level`{:class="microbitinput"} block.  

Place it inside the first `0` in the `plot bar graph of`{:class="microbitled"} block.

Change the second `0` to `255`.

```microbit
loops.everyInterval(500, function () {
    led.plotBarGraph(
    input.soundLevel(),
    255
    )
})
```

--- collapse ---

---
title: For micro:bit V1
---

There is no microphone on the micro:bit V1, so instead you can use the `light level`{:class="microbitinput"} block to measure the light levels of your environment.

![Animation showing the light level block being placed inside the first '0' on the 'plot bar graph of' block.](images/light-level.gif)

--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---

### Log the sound levels (V2 only)

The V2 micro:bit has a built-in data logger, which enables you to track data from various sensors and inputs. You will need to install an extension to use this.

--- task ---

On the menu panel, click on **Extensions**. Another window will open showing recommended extensions. Click on the **data logger** and it will be installed as a menu item.

![The data logger extension being installed by clicking the extensions menu and then 'data logger'. A new block menu appears labelled 'Data Logger'.](images/installing-datalogger.gif)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

From the `Data Logger`{:class="microbitdatalogger"} menu, drag a `log data`{:class="microbitdatalogger"} block.

<img src="images/data-logger.png" alt="The Data Logger menu with the 'log data column...value' block highlighted." width="350"/>

Place it below the `plot bar graph of`{:class='microbitled'} block.

```microbit
loops.everyInterval(500, function () {
    led.plotBarGraph(
    input.soundLevel(),
    255
    )
    datalogger.log(datalogger.createCV("", 0))
})
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Type `Sound level` in the column field.

```microbit
loops.everyInterval(500, function () {
    led.plotBarGraph(
    input.soundLevel(),
    255
    )
    datalogger.log(datalogger.createCV("Sound level", 0))
})
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

From the `Input`{:class="microbitinput"} menu, drag another `sound level`{:class="microbitinput"} block and place it inside the `0` on the `log data`{:class="microbitdatalogger"} block.

```microbit
loops.everyInterval(500, function () {
    led.plotBarGraph(
    input.soundLevel(),
    255
    )
    datalogger.log(datalogger.createCV("Sound level", input.soundLevel()))
})
```

--- /task ---

### Test your program

When you make a change to a code block in the code editor panel, the simulator will restart.

**Test your program**

+ Drag the red sound level bar up and down to change the sound levels.

**V2 only**

+ Click The '**Show data** Simulator' link below the micro:bit simulator to see the sound levels being logged.

![Animation showing the microphone bar on the microbit simulator being dragged up and down to increase and reduce the sound. The 'Show data' button is clicked to show the data being logged.](images/mic-test.gif)

Awesome work! You have created your first data display program on a micro:bit!
